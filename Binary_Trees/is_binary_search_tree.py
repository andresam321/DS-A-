# Time Complexity: O(n)
# You have to visit every node exactly once during the in-order traversal.

# No node is visited twice.

# Then, you iterate once through the list to check if it's sorted.

# So it's basically two O(n) operations:

# Traversal O(n)

# Checking if sorted O(n)

# Big-O ignores constants, so together, it's still O(n).

# Space Complexity: O(n)
# You are building a values list that stores every nodeâ€™s value.

# So for n nodes, the list has n values â†’ O(n) space.

# Also, recursion adds memory usage to the call stack.

# In the worst case (unbalanced tree, like a straight line), the recursion could go as deep as n.

# In a balanced tree, it's log(n) depth.

# But the list dominates because it's storing all n values explicitly.

# ðŸ‘‰ So overall space = O(n).
